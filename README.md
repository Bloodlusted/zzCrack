# zzCrack

(very bad coded but it works)

Ever forgot your password to a zipfile or you just want to crack the password for some reason, Then zzCrack is what you need

zzCrack.py is more advanced while zipCrack.py is super simple to use
(zzCrack is still not finished but will be released soon)


## Soon a v2 will come out which has some added features
